READCHAR
RC

	reads a single character from the read stream and outputs that
	character as a word.  If the read stream is a file, and the end of
	file is reached, READCHAR outputs the empty list (not the empty
	word).  If the read stream is the keyboard, echoing is turned off
	when READCHAR is invoked, and remains off until READLIST or READWORD
	is invoked or a Logo prompt is printed.  Backslash, vertical bar,
	and tilde characters have no special meaning in this context.
