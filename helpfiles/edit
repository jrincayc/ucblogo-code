(EDIT)
(ED)

	command.  Edits the definitions of the named items, using your
	favorite editor as determined by the EDITOR environment variable.
	If you don't have an EDITOR variable, edits the definitions using
	jove.  If invoked without an argument, EDIT edits the same
	temporary file left over from a previous EDIT instruction.
	When you leave the editor, Logo reads the revised definitions
	and modifies the workspace accordingly.

	If there is an environment variable called TEMP, then Logo uses
	its value as the directory in which to write the temporary file
	used for editing.

	Exceptionally, the EDIT command can be used without its default
	input and without parentheses provided that nothing follows it on
	the instruction line.
