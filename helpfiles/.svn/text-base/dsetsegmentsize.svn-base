.SETSEGMENTSIZE num

	command.  Sets the number of nodes that Logo allocates from the
	operating system at once to num, which must be a positive integer.
	The name is dotted because bad things will happen if you use a
	number that's too small or too large for your computer.  The
	initial value is 16,000 for most systems, but is smaller for
	68000-based Macs.  Making it larger will speed up computations
	(by reducing the number of garbage collections) at the cost of
	allocating more memory than necessary.
