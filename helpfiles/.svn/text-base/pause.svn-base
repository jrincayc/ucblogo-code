PAUSE

	command or operation.  Enters an interactive pause.  The user is
	prompted for instructions, as at toplevel, but with a prompt that
	includes the name of the procedure in which PAUSE was invoked.
	Local variables of that procedure are available during the pause.
	PAUSE outputs if the pause is ended by a CONTINUE with an input.

	If the variable ERRACT exists, and an error condition occurs, the
	contents of that variable are run as an instructionlist.  Typically
	ERRACT is given the value [PAUSE] so that an interactive pause will
	be entered in the event of an error.  This allows the user to check
	values of local variables at the time of the error.

	Typing the system quit character (alt-S for wxWidgets; otherwise
	normally control-\ for Unix, control-W for DOS, or command-comma for
	Mac) will also enter a pause.
