This version of Logo is designed for a machine with adequate memory.  It is
not likely to be usable as the basis for a 64K microcomputer implementation.

The interpreter was written primarily by Daniel Van Blerkom, Brian Harvey,
Michael Katz, and Douglas Orleans.  Thanks to Fred Gilham for the X11 code.

The Unix distribution includes a shell script called "configure" that
customizes Logo for your particular version of Unix.  Just type the
name "configure" at a shell prompt.  The script performs various tests to
see whether particular libraries, etc., are available.

The configure script writes several files.  The most important are

	makefile		used to compile Logo
	config.h		header file used by C source files

Note:  It also writes a file "config.cache" in which it remembers the results
of its tests.  If you copy the Logo source directory to another machine with
a different version of Unix and try to recompile, you should remove
config.cache before running configure.

With these files in place you should be able to say "make" to the shell
and get three results:

	logo			executable Logo interpreter
	logolib			directory with pseudo-primitives in Logo
	helpfiles		directory with online documentation

Alternatively, just say "make logo" if you want to preserve the
included logolib and helpfiles.

Say "make install" to copy the executable and library files to
/usr/local/bin/logo and /usr/local/lib/logo/*.

Logo assumes that you will install its library in /usr/local/logo!
If you would rather move these subdirectories somewhere else, then instead
of saying "make" you should say, e.g.,

	make LIBLOC=/usr/lib/logo

(If you have already said "make" before reading this, remove libloc.c
before giving the make command above.)

The distribution also includes the file "usermanual" which is a rather terse
description of this particular Logo dialect for people who already know how
to program in Logo.

The files ztc*, mac*, and win32* are for toy-computer versions of Logo.  But
if you are trying to compile for those machines you probably also need some
extra help beyond what's in here.  You can get complete PC and Mac versions
by anonymous FTP from anarres.cs.berkeley.edu.

----------

Here are the special features of this dialect of Logo:

	Random-access arrays.

	Variable number of inputs to user-defined procedures.

	Mutators for list structure (dangerous).

	Pause on error, and other improvements to error handling.

	Comments and continuation lines; formatting is preserved when
	procedure definitions are saved or edited.

	Terrapin-style tokenization (e.g., [2+3] is a list with one member)
	but LCSI-style syntax (no special forms except TO).  The best of
	both worlds.

	First-class instruction and expression templates.

	Macros.
